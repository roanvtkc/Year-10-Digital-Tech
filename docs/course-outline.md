# Course Outline (Staff Draft)

This outline aligns with the weekly skeleton in `planners/weekly/overview.md` and the outcome tags in `syllabus/outcomes.md`.

## Intent
Build the course around one major project, supported by smaller assessments that progressively develop the skills and knowledge required for the final outcome.

## Major project
- Title: (to be defined)
- Repository: https://github.com/roanvtkc/simpsons-house
- Summary: Capstone build that integrates UX/UI design, data modeling, programming, testing, and project management.

## Assessment set
See `docs/assessment-outline.md` for the draft mapping.
