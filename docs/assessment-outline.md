# Assessment Outline (Draft)

## Overview
The assessment structure uses one major project, supported by smaller assessments that build the required skills and knowledge. Outcome tags referenced below are defined in `syllabus/outcomes.md`.

## Assessment set (draft)
- Minor A1: UX/UI brief and prototype (client needs, UX/UI, design thinking)
- Minor A2: Data and database analysis task (spreadsheets + relational databases)
- Minor A3: Algorithms and modular programming sprint (functions, logical operators, testing)
- Minor A4: Privacy and security case study (APPs, supply chain vulnerabilities)
- Major M1: Capstone build (database-driven website/app tied to the main project)

## Major project
- Brief: `assessments/major-project/brief.md`
- Rubric: `assessments/major-project/rubric.md`
- Milestones: `assessments/major-project/milestones.md`
