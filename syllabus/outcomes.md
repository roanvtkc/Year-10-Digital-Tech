## Year 10 description (context)
In the middle adolescence phase of schooling, teaching and learning programs encourage students to
develop an open and questioning view of themselves as active participants in their society and the
world.
Digital Technologies further develops student understanding and skills in computational thinking,
such as precisely and accurately describing problems, and the use of modular approaches to
solutions. They investigate the potential and challenges of increased knowledge and choice of
technologies; and an understanding of the relationship between knowledge, technologies and
consumer and/or producer values.
In Year 10, students consider how human interaction with networked systems introduces
complexities surrounding access to, and the security and privacy of, data of various types. They
interrogate security practices and techniques used to compress data. Students explore the role of
hardware and software in managing, controlling and securing access to data, in networked digital
systems focusing on user or software supply chain vulnerabilities.
Students apply design thinking by using divergent techniques to generate design ideas for user
experiences and solutions. They develop and represent documents online as content (text), structure
(mark-up) and presentation (styling). Students analyse problems and design, and implement and
evaluate a range of solutions, such as database-driven websites, artificial intelligence engines and
simulations. They design and implement algorithms involving functions and logical operators and,
where appropriate, represent them as flow charts. Students further develop project management
skills through developing detailed plans with consideration of time, production processes, social,
ethical, economic and sustainability factors, and legal responsibilities.

## Achievement standard (Year 10)
By the end of the year:
Students describe how hardware and software manage, control and secure access to data in
networked digital systems with a focus on software supply chain vulnerabilities. They represent
documents online as content (text), structure (mark-up) and presentation (styling) and explain the
purpose of these distinctions. Students analyse and visualise data interactively using a range of
software, including spreadsheets and relational databases, to draw conclusions and make predictions
based on identified trends and outliers. They model and query entities and relationships using
structured data. Students apply the Australian Privacy Principles to critique systems and manage the
digital footprint of individuals.
Students define and decompose real-world problems and use data gathering techniques to create
user experiences and user interfaces. They design and prototype the user experience of a digital
system and algorithms involving functions, modules and logical operators, and represent them as
flow charts and/or pseudocode. Students validate algorithms and programs by comparing their
output against a range of test cases. They implement, modify and debug modular programs, applying
algorithms and data structures, in a programming language.
In Digital Technologies, students identify the needs of the client or stakeholder to determine the basis
for a solution. They develop and critique design briefs for a designed solution. Students investigate
components and resources to develop increasingly sophisticated solutions, identifying and
considering associated constraints. They apply design thinking, creativity, enterprise skills and
innovation to develop, modify and communicate detailed design ideas. Students design possible
solutions and analyse designs against criteria, including functionality, accessibility, usability and
aesthetics, using appropriate technical terms and technologies. They select, justify, implement and
test appropriate technologies and processes to produce designed solutions. They manage projects,
using digital technologies with an agile and collaborative approach, while considering time,
production processes, social, ethical, economic and sustainable factors, and legal responsibilities.
