# Minor A3: Algorithms and Modular Programming Sprint (Student)

## What you will do
You will design algorithms, represent them clearly, and implement modular code with functions and logical operators. You will validate your program using test cases.

## Deliverables
- Algorithm designs (flowchart and/or pseudocode)
- Modular program using functions and logical operators
- Test cases with expected and actual outputs
- Debug notes showing fixes

## Success criteria
- Algorithm design matches the implemented solution
- Code is modular and readable
- Test cases are valid and used to verify output
- Debugging shows evidence of improvement

## Curriculum links
- DI10-3 (WA10DIGDI3)
- DI10-4 (WA10DIGDI4)
- DI10-5 (WA10DIGDI5)

## Submission
Submit your algorithm design, code, and test evidence.
