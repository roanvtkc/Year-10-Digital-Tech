# Major Project Brief (Draft)

## Overview
Design and build a database-driven digital solution that demonstrates end-to-end project work: identifying a client need, designing UX/UI, modeling data, implementing modular code, testing, and delivering a polished solution. This is the capstone for Year 10 and is supported by the minor assessments.
