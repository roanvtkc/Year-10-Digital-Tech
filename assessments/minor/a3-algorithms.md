# Minor A3: Algorithms and Modular Programming Sprint

## Purpose
Design and implement modular algorithms, validate with test cases, and debug programs.

## Outcome tags
DI10-3, DI10-4, DI10-5

## Deliverables
- Algorithm designs (flow chart and/or pseudocode)
- Modular program using functions and logical operators
- Test cases with expected and actual outputs
- Debug notes showing fixes

## Evidence of learning
- Clear mapping from algorithm to code
- Correct use of functions and logical operators
- Validation against a range of test cases
