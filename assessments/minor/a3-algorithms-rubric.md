# Minor A3 Rubric: Algorithms and Modular Programming Sprint

## Criteria
- Algorithm design and representation
- Modular code quality
- Testing and validation
- Debugging and iteration
- Communication and documentation

## Performance levels
| Criteria | Exceeds | Meets | Approaches | Beginning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Algorithm design | Clear, efficient, well-represented | Clear and correct representation | Partial or unclear representation | Missing or incorrect |
| Modular code | Clean, modular, appropriate use of functions | Correct modular structure | Some modular structure | Little to no modular structure |
| Testing | Comprehensive test set; validated outputs | Adequate test set and validation | Limited tests | No tests |
| Debugging | Clear evidence of iteration and fixes | Some evidence of debugging | Minimal debugging evidence | None |
| Communication | Clear documentation and comments | Mostly clear documentation | Some gaps | Hard to follow |
