# Year 10 Digital Tech (2026)

This repository holds syllabus-aligned reference material, distilled notes, and planning artifacts for Year 10 Digital Technology (2026). The goal is to build a deep understanding of the SCSA documents, then translate that into weekly planners and assessment tasks. Over time this will be published as a student-facing website.

## Key links
- Major project codebase: https://github.com/roanvtkc/simpsons-house
- Existing website (target style/reference): https://computerscience.venterfamily.au

## Structure
- `syllabus/`: core syllabus notes and mappings
- `references/raw/`: source documents (PDFs, official publications)
- `references/processed/`: distilled extracts and summaries derived from sources
- `notes/`: working notes (concepts, vocabulary, weekly thinking)
- `planners/weekly/`: weekly planner drafts and templates
- `assessments/`: assessment outlines, briefs, rubrics
- `docs/`: course-wide documents (term dates, outlines, decisions)
- `assets/`: images and diagrams for future site content

## Working conventions
- Keep raw source documents in `references/raw/` and do not edit them.
- Capture extracted quotes or summaries in `references/processed/` with clear references back to sources.
- Keep each concept or topic note short and link out to syllabus outcomes.
